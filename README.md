# 🌿 Lyra Leaf SPAD Calibration

> 📛 **Projet Lyra** – Science participative augmentée • 🌱 Écologie reproductible • 🧠 Calibration IA • 🧪 ImageJ + Scanner • 📷 SPAD sans capteur propriétaire

## 🌿 Purpose
This project demonstrates a fully operational, low-cost, and reproducible method to estimate chlorophyll content (SPAD-like values) from scanned leaf images. The approach combines:

- A flatbed scanner
- ImageJ (Fiji)
- Manual SPAD measurements (SPAD-502 Minolta)
- A RGB calibration chart used to validate digital optical density over time
- Statistical modelling (regression)

The goal is to democratize plant physiological diagnostics using only free tools and common devices, without dependence on proprietary sensors.

## 🧭 Methodology (Full Chronology)

### 1. Visual Calibration Chart Assessment
- A Kodak-style RGB chart printed in 2009 was recovered.
- The vertical green scale (from 0 to 100) was visually intact and contrast-rich.
- A visual inspection in daylight confirmed no apparent fading.
- A detailed scan at 600 dpi PNG was used to assess channel integrity.

### 2. Validation of Color Stability Over Time
- The RGB chart was rescanned.
- 10 patches (10 to 100) were extracted.
- Pixel intensity values from the green channel were analyzed using Python.
- A very linear degradation was confirmed from patch 10 to 100.
- Special attention was given to the final two patches (90–100): the scanner clearly captured a 5-point difference in G values, undetectable to the human eye.

### 3. Historical Comparison with 2009 Densitometer Data
- In 2009, density measurements were taken on the same chart using a yellow-channel densitometer.
- These values were plotted and compared to the scanner’s green channel in 2025.
- After normalization, the two curves were nearly identical (R² ≈ 0.99).
- This confirmed that the scanner is a viable substitute for field-level optical density calibration.

### 4. ImageJ and Excel Manual Validation
- The RGB image was converted to grayscale.
- Each patch was analyzed manually using ImageJ (`freehand selections` + `Measure`).
- The data were exported to Excel.
- A second-order polynomial fit was performed.
- The curve confirmed the linearity and sensitivity of the grayscale across the green scale.

## 🍋 In Vivo Leaf Experiment (Citronnier)

### 🟢 Sampling
- 5 leaves were collected from a single lemon tree in pot (various stages: healthy, maturing, chlorotic).
- Each was scanned alongside its SPAD measurement written manually.
- 3 to 6 SPAD readings per leaf were averaged.

### 🔬 Measurement
- Each leaf was analyzed using ImageJ with calibrated Image → green DO.
- ROIs were drawn manually to match leaf areas.

### 📊 Dataset Collected
| DO vert (ImageJ) | SPAD (mean) |
|------------------|-------------|
| 227.9            | 18.1        |
| 322.5            | 27.0        |
| 384.0            | 32.0        |
| 323.3            | 30.0        |
| 481.4            | 56.0        |

### 📈 Resulting Model
- Polynomial regression (2nd order): R² = 0.9705
- The model accurately captures the non-linearity of chlorophyll saturation
- Allows extrapolation from DO → SPAD across the typical range 15–60

## 🖼️ Result

![Modèle SPAD-DO verte](result/Modele_SPAD_DO_verte.png)

This plot shows the regression fit obtained from five leaf samples scanned and measured. Despite the limited number of points, the model captures the physiological behavior of chlorophyll concentration: slow rise at low DO, rapid increase in the mid-range, and saturation beyond DO ~450. This curve will be used to simulate additional synthetic data for Lyra_Leaf training.

## 🤖 Integration in Lyra Ecosystem
- This protocol is compatible with Lyra_Leaf and science participative AI pipelines.
- It enables training of GPT-based models from structured SPAD-DO pairs.
- The approach is low-cost, reproducible, transparent, and sensor-independent.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
- A 15-year-old RGB chart can still serve for optical calibration
- Flatbed scanners provide sufficient resolution and fidelity to detect differences undetectable by eye
- Manual ImageJ analysis is consistent with Python automation
- SPAD-like diagnostics are possible with zero proprietary tools

This repository demonstrates the scientific validity of **participative ecological diagnostics** and opens the door for **low-cost chlorophyll tracking**, ready for future AI and field integration.
